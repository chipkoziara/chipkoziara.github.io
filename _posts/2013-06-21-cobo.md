Cobo Center in downtown Detroit is getting a new look. The [$279 million renovation](http://www.freep.com/article/20120504/BUSINESS06/205040443/Cobo-s-rebirth-delivers-business/ "Cobo's Rebirth Delivers Business") will be completed by early 2015. 

I'm sure the extra space will be used in future North American Auto Shows but I hope the upgraded facility is utilized to its full potential year-round, especially now that events at Cobo are [cheaper for exhibitors](http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20130620/NEWS/130629990/cobo-authority-secures-new-work-rules-with-unions-to-save-exhibitors/ "Cobo authority secures new work rules with unions to save exhibitors money").

**Update 08/14/13:** I was contacted by a representative from the Cobo Center and informed that the project is slated to cost $279 million instead of the $299 million listed in the Free Press article.
