Here are a few great interactive maps for those interested in exploring geospatial data. I'll populate the list with more maps as I come across them:

* [Block by Block, Brooklynâ€™s Past and Present](http://bklynr.com/block-by-block-brooklyns-past-and-present/) via BKLYNR
* [Buildings in the Netherlands by year of construction](http://dev.citysdk.waag.org/buildings/) via Waag Society
* [PLUTO Data Visualizations](http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/pluto/#0) via Andrew Hill. This is a collection of visualizations from NYC's PLUTO data
* [OpenData Globe](http://dev.citysdk.waag.org/visualisation/) via CitySDK and Waag Society. This is a 3D visualization of real time public transit and traffic trips across several European cities including Amsterdam, Helsinki and Istanbul
* [Rent Affordability Gap in San Francisco](http://www.mizmay.com/2013/05/Rental-Housing-SF.html/) via Stephanie May

![NYC Building Height Approximations](/images/pluto.jpg)

The above image is an approximation of NYC's building heights from the [PLUTO Data Visualizations](http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/pluto/#0) link above by Andrew Hill.
